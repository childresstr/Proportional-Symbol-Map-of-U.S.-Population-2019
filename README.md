This map represents the population estimates of all 50 states within the U.S. in 2019 from data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. The circles over each state are proportionally scaled to reflect size in population. Therefore, the smaller the circle, the smaller the population. Looking at this map it is easy to infer that the majority of the country's population resides in the eastern portion where there are clusters of larger circles over the states. The size of the state does not inherently go hand in hand with population size, for example, Montana is much larger than Massachusetts yet has a fraction of the population that Massachusetts has. To further examine the map, you can zoom in to de-clutter the smaller states with larger populations and at the same time, you will see the sizes of the circles adjust accordingly to the level of inspection while remaining proportional. This map would have great usage by classrooms to exhibit settlement sizes, for citizens to better understand country dynamics or for the foreign observer looking to gain a familiarity of the nation and our unique distribution.
